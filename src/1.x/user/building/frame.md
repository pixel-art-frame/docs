# Frame

The frame is really up to your own preferences. 
If you have a 3D printer you can print a frame. If you're good at woodworking you can create a frame out of wood.

It would be great if there was a gallery of frames for others to get inspiration.

If you make your own frame, please share it so that we can add it to this page!
